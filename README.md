# F5-TTS-Emotion-CFG

This repository is based on [**F5-TTS**](https://github.com/SWivid/F5-TTS?tab=readme-ov-file#f5-tts-a-fairytaler-that-fakes-fluent-and-faithful-speech-with-flow-matching): A Fairytaler that Fakes Fluent and Faithful Speech with Flow Matching from [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18009)

F5-TTS-Emotion-CFG introudces explicit emotion conditioning in F5-TTS model zero-shot voice cloning model, by fine-tuning on [ESD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14794) dataset.

The following emotions are supported: Neutral, Happy, Sad, Angry and Surprised.

## How to install

Step1:

    conda create --name f5-tts-emo python==3.10.0

    conda activate f5-tts-emo

Step 2:

    pip install -e .

## Download models

Execute the script:

    python download_models.py

Or download the models from [ü§ó Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/RaduBolbo/F5-TTS-Emotion-CFG-1/tree/main) and coppy them in the `ckpts` directory.

## How to use (inference)

*‚ö†Ô∏è First of all install the [requirements](#how-to-install) and [download](#download-models) the models.*


Use the CLI interface defiend in `src/f5_tts/infer/infer_cli_emotion.py`:

    python src/f5_tts/infer/infer_cli_emotion.py \
        --ref-audio-path "data/0011_angry.wav" \
        --ref-text "The nine, the eggs, I keep." \
        --inference-text "Hello, this is a text to check emotion." \
        --inference-emotion Surprise \
        --cfg-strength2 10 \
        --output-path "data/output.wav"

- --ref-audio-path: Path to the reference audio file for voice cloning. Provides the speaker‚Äôs voice.

- --ref-text: Transcription of the reference audio (the text that is being said).

- --ref-emotion: The emotion in the reference audio clip (in most practical cases it can work with `Neutral` as default)

- --inference-text: The new text you want the model to synthesize.

- --inference-emotion: Target emotion for synthesis. Options: `Angry`, `Happy`, `Sad`, `Neutral`, `Surprise`.

- --cfg-strength2: Classifier-free guidance strength for emotion control. Higher = stronger emotion, but too high may reduce naturalness. Typical values range from 2 up to 20.

- --output-path: Path where the generated audio will be saved.
